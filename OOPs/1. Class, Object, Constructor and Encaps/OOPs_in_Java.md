# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. Java is a language that strongly supports OOP principles.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Objects

**Definition:** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state and behavior.

**Key Characteristics of Objects:**

- **State:** Represented by attributes or fields (e.g., a car's color, brand, and model).
- **Behavior:** Represented by methods or functions (e.g., a car can drive, brake, or honk).
- **Identity:** Each object has a unique identity, which distinguishes it from other objects, even if they have the same state and behavior.

**How Objects Work:**

- Objects are created using the `new` keyword in Java.
- They occupy memory space and can interact with other objects through method calls.

**Advantages of Using Objects:**

- **Modularity:** Objects help break down complex systems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Reusability:** Objects can be reused across different parts of a program or even in other programs.
- **Encapsulation:** Objects bundle data and methods together, promoting data security and abstraction.

**Example in Real Life:**

- A **Person** object can have attributes like name, age, and height (state) and behaviors like walking, talking, and eating (methods).

**Code Example:**

```java
class Person {
    String name;
    int age;

    void introduce() {
        System.out.println("Hi, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.name = "Alice";
        person.age = 25;
        person.introduce();
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hi, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.
```

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Classes

**Definition:** A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created. It defines fields and methods.

**Key Characteristics of Classes:**

- **Blueprint for Objects:** A class provides the structure and behavior that its objects will have.
- **Encapsulation:** Classes encapsulate data and methods, ensuring modularity and security.
- **Reusability:** Classes can be reused in different parts of a program or in other programs.
- **Inheritance Support:** Classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, promoting code reuse.

**Components of a Class:**

1. **Fields (Attributes):** Variables that hold the state of the object.
2. **Methods:** Functions that define the behavior of the object.
3. **Constructors:** Special methods used to initialize objects.
4. **Access Modifiers:** Keywords like `public`, `private`, `default` and `protected` that control access to class members.

**Real-Life Example:** A **Car class** is a blueprint. Multiple car objects like sedan, SUV, and hatchback can be made from it.

**Syntax:**

```java
class ClassName {
    // fields
    // methods
}
```

**Code Example:**

```java
class Car {
    String model;
    int year;

    void honk() {
        System.out.println("Honking");
    }
}
```

**Use Case:** Organizing car-related data and behaviors like honking and model/year info.

**Advantages of Using Classes:**

- **Modularity:** Classes help divide a program into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Abstraction:** Classes allow hiding of implementation details while exposing only necessary functionalities.
- **Scalability:** Classes make it easier to scale applications by adding new features or modifying existing ones.

**Best Practices for Defining Classes:**

- Use meaningful names for classes that reflect their purpose.
- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Use access modifiers to enforce encapsulation.
- Document the purpose and usage of the class for better maintainability.
- Avoid making classes unnecessarily large; split them into smaller, cohesive classes if needed.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Abstraction

**Definition:** Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of a showing only the relevant information to the user. It focuses on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it.

**Key Characteristics of Abstraction:**

- **Simplification:** Reduces complexity by showing only the relevant details to the user.
- **Focus on Functionality:** Allows developers to focus on high-level design without worrying about implementation details.
- **Improved Maintainability:** Changes to the internal implementation do not affect the external interface.

**Real-Life Example:** A **Car dashboard** provides controls like steering, accelerator, and speedometer. The user interacts with these controls without needing to understand the internal mechanics of the engine or transmission.

**Types of Abstraction in Java:**

1. **Abstract Classes:** Classes that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods.
2. **Interfaces:** Fully abstract types that define a contract for classes to implement.

### âž¤ Abstract Classes

**Syntax:**

```java
abstract class ClassName {
    // Abstract method (no body)
    abstract void methodName();

    // Concrete method (with body)
    void concreteMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a concrete method.");
    }
}
```

**Code Example:**

```java
abstract class Car {
    abstract void start();

    void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car is stopping.");
    }
}

class Sedan extends Car {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Sedan starting with key.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Sedan();
        myCar.start();
        myCar.stop();
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Sedan starting with key.
Car is stopping.
```

**Use Case:** Abstract classes are useful when we want to provide a common base class with some shared functionality while allowing subclasses to define specific behaviors.

### âž¤ Interfaces

**Syntax:**

```java
interface InterfaceName {
    void methodName();
}
```

**Code Example:**

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
    void stop();
}

class Bike implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Bike starting with kick.");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Bike is stopping.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle myBike = new Bike();
        myBike.start();
        myBike.stop();
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Bike starting with kick.
Bike is stopping.
```

**Use Case:** Interfaces are ideal for defining a contract that multiple classes can implement, ensuring consistency across different implementations.

**Advantages of Abstraction:**

- **Code Reusability:** Abstract classes and interfaces promote code reuse by defining common behaviors.
- **Flexibility:** Allows developers to change the implementation without affecting the external interface.
- **Security:** Hides sensitive implementation details from the user.

**Best Practices for Abstraction:**

- Use abstract classes when you need to share code among related classes.
- Use interfaces when you need to define a contract for unrelated classes.
- Avoid overusing abstraction, as it can lead to unnecessary complexity.

> ðŸ“˜ **Note:** Abstraction is a cornerstone of OOP, enabling developers to build scalable and maintainable applications by separating concerns and focusing on high-level design.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Encapsulation

**Definition:** Encapsulation is the technique of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit and restricting access to some components. It ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside world, exposing only what is necessary.

**Key Characteristics of Encapsulation:**

- **Data Hiding:** Internal details of an object are hidden, and only a controlled interface is exposed.
- **Access Control:** Access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public` are used to control access to class members.
- **Improved Security:** Sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access or modification.
- **Ease of Maintenance:** Changes to the internal implementation do not affect external code that uses the object.

**Advantages of Encapsulation:**

1. **Improved Code Maintainability:** Encapsulation allows changes to the internal implementation without affecting external code.
2. **Enhanced Security:** By restricting access to certain components, encapsulation prevents unintended interference or misuse.
3. **Modularity:** Encapsulation helps in dividing a program into smaller, manageable parts.
4. **Reusability:** Encapsulated code can be reused across different parts of a program or in other programs.
5. **Flexibility:** Encapsulation allows developers to modify the internal workings of a class without impacting its external behavior.

**Real-Life Example:** A **Car's speedometer**â€”you can see the speed but can't directly change the way it calculates speed. The internal mechanism is hidden, and only the result is exposed.

**How Encapsulation Works in Java:**

1. Declare the variables of a class as `private`.
2. Provide `public` getter and setter methods to access and update the values of private variables.

**Syntax (getter/setter):**

```java
private Type var;
public Type getVar();
public void setVar(Type val);
```

**Code Example:**

```java
class Car {
    private int speed;

    // Getter method
    public int getSpeed() {
        return speed;
    }

    // Setter method
    public void setSpeed(int s) {
        if (s >= 0) { // Adding validation
            speed = s;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Speed cannot be negative.");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.setSpeed(50); // Setting speed
        System.out.println("Car speed: " + myCar.getSpeed()); // Getting speed
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Car speed: 50
```

**Best Practices for Encapsulation:**

1. Always declare class variables as `private` to restrict direct access.
2. Use meaningful names for getter and setter methods, following the naming convention (`getVariableName`, `setVariableName`).
3. Add validation logic in setter methods to ensure data integrity.
4. Avoid exposing unnecessary internal details through getter and setter methods.
5. Document the purpose of each getter and setter method for better maintainability.

> ðŸ“˜ **Note:** Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of OOP that promotes data security, modularity, and maintainability, making it easier to build robust and scalable applications.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Inheritance

**Definition:** Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows one class (child or subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a natural hierarchy between classes.

**Real-Life Example:** An **ElectricCar** inherits general properties from a **Car** like wheels, steering, and the ability to drive, while adding its own unique behavior, such as charging the battery.

---

### âž¤ Subclasses and Superclasses in Inheritance:

1. **Superclass (Parent Class):**

   - A superclass, also known as a _base class_ or _parent class_, is the class from which other classes inherit. It contains common attributes and methods that can be shared across multiple subclasses.
   - The superclass provides a foundation of functionality that can be reused and extended by its subclasses.
   - Example: In a `Vehicle` superclass, attributes like `speed` and methods like `start()` can be defined, which are common to all types of vehicles.

2. **Subclass (Child Class):**

   - A subclass, also known as a _derived class_ or _child class_, is a class that inherits from a superclass. It can use the attributes and methods of the superclass and also define its own unique behavior.
   - Subclasses can override methods from the superclass to provide specific implementations or add new methods and attributes.
   - Example: A `Car` subclass can inherit from the `Vehicle` superclass and add specific attributes like `numberOfDoors` or override the `start()` method to include additional functionality.

3. **Relationship Between Subclass and Superclass:**

   - The subclass is a specialized version of the superclass. This "is-a" relationship is a key principle of inheritance. For example, a `Car` is a `Vehicle`.
   - Subclasses can access public and protected members of the superclass but cannot directly access private members unless accessor methods (like getters and setters) are provided.

4. **Terminology Recap:**

   - Superclass: Also called _base class_ or _parent class_.
   - Subclass: Also called _derived class_ or _child class_.

5. **Example in Java:**

   ```java
   // Superclass
   class Vehicle {
       int speed;

       void start() {
           System.out.println("Vehicle is starting");
       }
   }

   // Subclass
   class Car extends Vehicle {
       int numberOfDoors;

       @Override
       void start() {
           System.out.println("Car is starting");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Car myCar = new Car();
           myCar.start(); // Output: Car is starting
       }
   }
   ```

### âž¤ Syntax:

```java
class ParentClass {
    // fields and methods
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    // additional fields and methods
}
```

---

### âž¤ Code Example:

```java
class Car {
    String brand;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a car");
    }
}

class ElectricCar extends Car {
    int batteryCapacity;

    void charge() {
        System.out.println("Charging the battery");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ElectricCar myElectricCar = new ElectricCar();
        myElectricCar.brand = "Tesla";
        myElectricCar.batteryCapacity = 100;
        myElectricCar.drive(); // Inherited from Car
        myElectricCar.charge(); // Defined in ElectricCar
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Driving a car
Charging the battery
```

---

### âž¤ Types of Inheritance in Java:

1. **Single Inheritance:** A child class inherits from one parent class.

   ```java
   class Parent {}
   class Child extends Parent {}
   ```

2. **Multilevel Inheritance:** A class inherits from a child class, forming a chain.

   ```java
   class Grandparent {}
   class Parent extends Grandparent {}
   class Child extends Parent {}
   ```

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance:** Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.
   ```java
   class Parent {}
   class Child1 extends Parent {}
   class Child2 extends Parent {}
   ```

> ðŸ“˜ **Note:** Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity (the "diamond problem"). However, it can be achieved using interfaces.

---

### âž¤ Method Overriding in Inheritance:

Child classes can provide their own implementation of a method defined in the parent class. This is known as **method overriding**.

**Code Example:**

```java
class Car {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting a generic car");
    }
}

class SportsCar extends Car {
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting a sports car with a roar");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new SportsCar();
        myCar.start(); // Calls the overridden method in SportsCar
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Starting a sports car with a roar
```

---

### âž¤ Advantages of Inheritance:

1. **Code Reusability:** Reduces duplication by reusing existing code in parent classes.
2. **Improved Maintainability:** Changes in the parent class automatically propagate to child classes.
3. **Extensibility:** Allows adding new features to child classes without modifying the parent class.
4. **Polymorphism:** Enables dynamic method invocation, improving flexibility and scalability.

---

### âž¤ Best Practices for Using Inheritance:

1. **Use Inheritance for "Is-A" Relationships:** Ensure the child class is a specialized version of the parent class (e.g., an ElectricCar "is a" Car).
2. **Avoid Deep Inheritance Hierarchies:** Keep the hierarchy shallow to reduce complexity and improve readability.
3. **Favor Composition Over Inheritance:** Use composition when a "Has-A" relationship is more appropriate (e.g., a Car "has a" Engine).
4. **Override Methods Judiciously:** Only override methods when necessary to provide specific behavior in the child class.
5. **Document the Hierarchy:** Clearly document the purpose of each class in the hierarchy for better maintainability.

> ðŸ“˜ **Note:** Inheritance is a powerful tool in OOP, but it should be used carefully to avoid tight coupling and maintain a clean, modular design.

---

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Polymorphism

**Definition:** Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a single interface or method to represent different behaviors based on the object or context. The term "polymorphism" is derived from the Greek words "poly" (many) and "morph" (forms), meaning "many forms."

**Real-Life Example:** Consider the action of starting a car. Different types of cars may start in different ways:

- A traditional car may start with a key.
- A modern car may start with a push-button.
- A luxury car may start remotely using a mobile app.

Despite the differences in implementation, the action is conceptually the same: starting the car.

---

### âž¤ Types of Polymorphism in Java

Java supports two types of polymorphism:

1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading):**

   - Achieved by defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within the same class.
   - The method to be called is determined at compile time based on the method signature.

2. **Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding):**
   - Achieved by defining a method in a subclass with the same name and signature as a method in its superclass.
   - The method to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.

---

### âž¤ Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)

**Definition:** Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameter lists (number, type, or order of parameters). It is resolved during the compilation phase.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Methods must have the same name but different parameter lists.
- Return type can be the same or different.
- It is a form of static binding.

**Syntax:**

```java
class ClassName {
     returnType methodName(param1);
     returnType methodName(param1, param2);
}
```

**Code Example:**

```java
class Car {
     // Method with no parameters
     void start() {
          System.out.println("Starting the car");
     }

     // Overloaded method with one parameter
     void start(String mode) {
          System.out.println("Starting the car in " + mode + " mode");
     }

     // Overloaded method with two parameters
     void start(String mode, int speed) {
          System.out.println("Starting the car in " + mode + " mode at speed " + speed + " km/h");
     }
}

public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          Car myCar = new Car();
          myCar.start(); // Calls the method with no parameters
          myCar.start("Eco"); // Calls the method with one parameter
          myCar.start("Sport", 100); // Calls the method with two parameters
     }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Starting the car
Starting the car in Eco mode
Starting the car in Sport mode at speed 100 km/h
```

**Use Case:** Method overloading is useful when you want to provide multiple ways to perform the same action, such as starting a car with different configurations.

---

### âž¤ Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

**Definition:** Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is resolved during the runtime phase.

**Key Characteristics:**

- The method in the subclass must have the same name, return type, and parameter list as the method in the superclass.
- The `@Override` annotation is used to indicate that a method is being overridden.
- It is a form of dynamic binding.

**Syntax:**

```java
class SuperClass {
     returnType methodName() {
          // implementation
     }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass {
     @Override
     returnType methodName() {
          // new implementation
     }
}
```

**Code Example:**

```java
// Superclass
class Car {
     void start() {
          System.out.println("Starting a generic car");
     }
}

// Subclass
class SportsCar extends Car {
     @Override
     void start() {
          System.out.println("Starting a sports car with a roar");
     }
}

public class Main {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          Car myCar = new SportsCar(); // Polymorphic reference
          myCar.start(); // Calls the overridden method in SportsCar
     }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Starting a sports car with a roar
```

**Use Case:** Method overriding is useful when you want to allow subclasses to define their own specific behavior while maintaining a consistent interface.

### âž¤ Differences Between Method Overloading and Method Overriding

| Feature         | Method Overloading                     | Method Overriding                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**  | Same method name, different parameters | Same method name, same parameters     |
| **Binding**     | Static (compile-time)                  | Dynamic (runtime)                     |
| **Inheritance** | Not required                           | Requires inheritance                  |
| **Return Type** | Can be different                       | Must be the same or covariant         |
| **Annotation**  | Not required                           | `@Override` annotation is recommended |

---

### âž¤ Advantages of Polymorphism

1. **Code Reusability:** Polymorphism allows the same method to be reused for different types of objects or scenarios.
2. **Flexibility:** Enables dynamic method invocation, allowing behavior to be determined at runtime.
3. **Extensibility:** Makes it easier to extend existing code by adding new classes or methods without modifying existing ones.
4. **Improved Readability:** Reduces code duplication and improves clarity by using a consistent interface.

---

### âž¤ Best Practices for Using Polymorphism

1. **Use Method Overloading for Convenience:** Provide multiple ways to perform the same action, but avoid excessive overloading that can confuse users.
2. **Use Method Overriding for Specialization:** Allow subclasses to define their own behavior while maintaining a consistent interface.
3. **Leverage the `@Override` Annotation:** Always use the `@Override` annotation to ensure that the method is correctly overriding a superclass method.
4. **Avoid Overusing Polymorphism:** While polymorphism is powerful, overusing it can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code.
5. **Document Behavior Clearly:** Clearly document the behavior of overloaded and overridden methods to avoid confusion.

> ðŸ“˜ **Note:** Polymorphism is a cornerstone of OOP, enabling developers to write flexible, reusable, and maintainable code. By mastering polymorphism, you can design systems that are both robust and scalable.

## ðŸ”¹ OOP in Java

**Definition:**  
Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that implements OOP principles strictly. It allows developers to design software by modeling real-world entities as objects, making the code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

### Key Features:

- **Class-based structure:**  
  Java organizes code into classes, which act as blueprints for creating objects.
- **Support for OOP principles:**  
  Java supports the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming:

  1. **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features.
  2. **Encapsulation:** Wrapping data (fields) and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access using access modifiers.
  3. **Inheritance:** Allowing a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
  4. **Polymorphism:** Enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms (e.g., method overloading and overriding).

- **Built-in access modifiers:**  
  Java provides four access levels to control visibility:
  - `private`: Accessible only within the same class.
  - `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
  - `protected`: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
  - Default (no modifier): Accessible within the same package.

**Syntax Example:**

```java
public class ClassName {
    // fields (variables) and methods
}
```

**Use Case:**  
OOP principles are ideal for building robust, modular, and scalable applications. For example, in a car-related Java application, you can model cars as objects with attributes like `color`, `model`, and `speed`, and behaviors like `drive()` and `brake()`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Related Concepts

### âž¤ Constructor

**Definition:**  
A constructor is a special method invoked when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's state (fields). Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

**Real-Life Example:**  
Think of a **Car factory** that uses a constructor to create a fully set-up car. For example, when a car is manufactured, it is initialized with specific attributes like its model, color, and engine type.

**Syntax:**

```java
ClassName() {
    // initialization code
}
```

**Code Example:**

```java
class Car {
    String model;
    String color;

    // Constructor
    Car(String model, String color) {
        this.model = model;
        this.color = color;
        System.out.println("Car constructed: " + model + " in " + color);
    }
}
```

**Use Case:**  
Constructors are particularly useful for automatically initializing object data during creation. For example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car("Sedan", "Red");
        Car car2 = new Car("SUV", "Blue");
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Car constructed: Sedan in Red
Car constructed: SUV in Blue
```

---

### âž¤ Encapsulation

**Definition:**  
Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, typically using access modifiers.

**Real-Life Example:**  
A car's engine is encapsulated within the car. You cannot directly access or modify the engine's internal components; instead, you use the car's interface (like the accelerator pedal) to interact with it.

**Code Example:**

```java
class Car {
    private String model; // private field

    // Public getter method
    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    // Public setter method
    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }
}
```

**Use Case:**  
Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is protected from unintended interference and misuse. For example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.setModel("Sedan");
        System.out.println("Car model: " + car.getModel());
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Car model: Sedan
```

---

### âž¤ Inheritance

**Definition:**  
Inheritance allows a class (child class) to acquire the properties and methods of another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

**Real-Life Example:**  
A **Car** is a type of **Vehicle**. The `Car` class can inherit common properties like `speed` and `fuel` from the `Vehicle` class while adding its own specific features.

**Code Example:**

```java
class Vehicle {
    int speed;

    void move() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle is moving at speed: " + speed);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    String model;

    void displayModel() {
        System.out.println("Car model: " + model);
    }
}
```

**Use Case:**  
Inheritance simplifies code by allowing shared functionality to reside in a parent class. For example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.speed = 100;
        car.model = "Sedan";
        car.move();
        car.displayModel();
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Vehicle is moving at speed: 100
Car model: Sedan
```

### âž¤ Polymorphism

**Definition:**  
Polymorphism allows methods to perform different tasks based on the object that calls them. It can be achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) or method overriding (runtime polymorphism).

**Real-Life Example:**  
A **Car** can behave differently based on its type. For example, a sports car accelerates faster than a regular car.

**Code Example:**

```java
class Car {
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a car");
    }
}

class SportsCar extends Car {
    @Override
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving a sports car at high speed");
    }
}
```

**Use Case:**  
Polymorphism enables flexibility and scalability in code. For example:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car();
        Car car2 = new SportsCar();

        car1.drive(); // Calls Car's drive method
        car2.drive(); // Calls SportsCar's drive method
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Driving a car
Driving a sports car at high speed
```

### âž¤ Interface

**Definition:** An interface is a contract that a class can implement. It contains abstract methods only.

**Real-Life Example:** A **Car control interface** defines buttons like accelerate and brake. Any car can implement these.

**Syntax:**

```java
interface InterfaceName {
    void method();
}
```

**Code Example:**

```java
interface CarFeatures {
    void playMusic();
}

class LuxuryCar implements CarFeatures {
    public void playMusic() {
        System.out.println("Playing music in car");
    }
}
```

**Use Case:** Implementing a common set of features across various car types.

---

### âž¤ "this" Keyword

**Definition:** The `this` keyword refers to the current instance of the class.

**Real-Life Example:** Inside a **Car object**, saying "this color" refers to the specific car's color.

**Syntax:**

```java
this.variableName = variableName;
```

**Code Example:**

```java
class Car {
    String brand;
    Car(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }
}
```

**Use Case:** Clarifying object fields when variable names conflict with method parameters.
