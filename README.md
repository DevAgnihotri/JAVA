## Introduction to OOPs

OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming System, a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. Java is a pure object-oriented programming language.

## Core Concepts

### Class and Object

- **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object**: Instance of a class.

### Inheritance

- Enables one class to inherit the properties and methods of another.
- Promotes code reusability.

### Polymorphism

- Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.
- Achieved through method overloading and overriding.

### Abstraction

- Hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features.
- Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

### Encapsulation

- Bundles data and methods that operate on the data within one unit.
- Access to data is restricted using access modifiers.

## Access Modifiers

Java provides four access modifiers: `private`, `default`, `protected`, and `public`, which control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables.

## Constructors and Destructors

- **Constructors**: Special methods invoked at the time of object creation.
- **Destructors**: Java uses garbage collection instead of destructors.

## Method Overloading and Overriding

- **Overloading**: Same method name with different parameters.
- **Overriding**: Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method declared in its superclass.

## Interfaces and Abstract Classes

- **Abstract Classes**: Cannot be instantiated, can have abstract and concrete methods.
- **Interfaces**: Only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default and static methods).

## Examples and Code Snippets

Check out the `examples/` directory for practical implementations of the above concepts.
